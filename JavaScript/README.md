## Who is this course for?

This corse is designed to reintroduce you to concepts that you might be using on a daily basis but don't really understand why.

This is targeted towards individuals who have been using JavaScript for one to three years who want to take their knowledge to the next level.

## What to expect?

In each section you will be introduced to a topic, provided a definitions, examples, and end with some exercise.

The exercises are intended to reinforce what was just learned. Please refer to the slides of that section for reference. We will be walking around to offer assitance if needed.
