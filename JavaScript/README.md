My name is Jeremy "Jermbo" Lawson. You can find me on Twitter and GitHub @jermbo

I have been in the industry for over 15 years. Started off as a designer and illustrator, then moved to developer a little over 12 years ago.

I host several events and meetups. Palm Beach JavaScript, BocaJS, and Palm Beach FrontEnd Developers.

I help run a non-profit dedicated to teaching kids to code called Code Palm Beach.
